# LiveEntertainmentSocialMediaSite
Hi there! This repository is a personal project where I attempt to create a entertainment-centered social media website where users can explore new events and see what events others are attending. 

## Concept
The concept of this project is a site where people can explore upcoming shows, post about events they are attending or have already attended, as well as follow other people and see what they are doing. I love the rise of focused social media apps, like beli or Strava, but haven't found a dedicated space for live entertainment yet. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is really for me to deepen my knowledge in familiar areas of web development, as well as to learn new technologies, like Next.js and Multer. While I have done frontend and full stack web development before, this is a new opportunity for me to create something from scratch and make design decisions myself. 

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React
- Next.js - using server-side rendering, static site generation, and app-based routing features
- Chakra UI - used their components for some features/pages I created earlier in this project, but also trying to challenge myself to use and style plain HTML.
- Various Icon Libraries

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js - used to quickly create new API endpoints 
- Multer - used to manipulate and store uploaded images
- MySQL - used for reading and writing to SQL database
- TicketMaster Discovery API - used to generate "Explore" page and search results
